# Reason Mui Binding Generator

This library generates bindings for
[material-ui](https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com/). It's automatically generated by an adaption of  [reason-rt-binding-generator](https://github.com/astrada/reason-rt-binding-generator) (created by [astrada](https://github.com/astrada)).

## Prerequisites

Clone & rename the `env.example.js` in the `scripts` folder and enter the path to your `material-ui` **master clone** (this is **not** the NPM version!!).

1. Install
   [reason-cli](https://reasonml.github.io/guide/editor-tools/global-installation#recommended-through-npmyarn).

2. Install JS dependencies:

       yarn install
       cd extract; yarn install

## How to (re)generate bindings
    cd extract; yarn extract
    yarn parse
