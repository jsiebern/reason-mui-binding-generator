# Reason Mui Binding Generator

This library generates bindings for
[material-ui](https://material-ui.com/). It's automatically generated by an adaption of  [reason-rt-binding-generator](https://github.com/astrada/reason-rt-binding-generator) (created by [astrada](https://github.com/astrada)).

## Prerequisites

The build tool assumes both the `reason-mui-binding-generator` and `material-ui` git repositories are cloned in the same parent directory. If this is not the case, modify `extract/package.json` to point to the correct location of your `material-ui` clone.

Make sure the `material-ui` directory is a clone, **not** the NPM version!!.

1. Install
   [reason-cli](https://reasonml.github.io/guide/editor-tools/global-installation#recommended-through-npmyarn).

2. Install JS dependencies:

       yarn install
       cd extract; yarn install

3. (Re)generate bindings

       cd extract; yarn copy; yarn extract
       yarn parse

4. (Re)generate ppx extension

       yarn ppx

The generated bindings can be found in output/reason
